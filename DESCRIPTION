Description: The Minorize-Maximization(MM) algorithm based on Assembly-Decomposition(AD) technology can be used for model estimation of parametric models, semi-parametric models and non-parametric models. We selected parametric models including left truncated normal distribution, type I multivariate zero-inflated generalized poisson distribution and multivariate compound zero-inflated generalized poisson distribution; semiparametric models include Cox model and gamma frailty model; nonparametric model is estimated for type II interval-censored data. These general methods are proposed based on the following papers,
